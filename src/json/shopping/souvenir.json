Having traveled to Cambodia first to attend a traditional Khmer wedding five years ago in the Kampot district, we discovered a country that despite the well documented horrific past, contains people with immense creative flair and ingenious workmanship. Our mission is to bring economic empowerment and a sustainable income to our artisans in the developing world. We build strong relationships with them, which broaden our understanding and appreciation of not only their needs, but also their hopes and dreams. We then import the results of their creative workmanship, these unique and interesting products, making them available to you, the consumer.",
